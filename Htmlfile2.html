        <h1>Final Goodbye</h1>
        <p>
        On March 22, 2024, something happened sadly to the website. 
        <br>
        A teacher (Mrs.Mudd) had heard a lot of words including "Interstellar" directed towards me, so I had to stay after class.<br>
        Sadly, this had let to me needing to shut down the website because they have figured me (us?) out.<br>
        Feel free to use other websites, but for me this will be (maybe)  the final goodbye.<br> 
        
        Q: So, what's happening to the website?
        
        <br> A: If it's not obvious already, it's being shut down. I am glad everyone had it a long the way, but there is other redirect tools and websites out there.
